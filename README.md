# Map Bearing Calculator
A tool primarily to assist in the construction of military live firing range traces.

This is just a small script that I originally wrote to get a map bearing between two grid references after getting sick of dull and repetative Army map reading tests! The units used for map bearings are "Military Mils" which is the unit many western armies use instead of degrees, but you're welcome to branch the repisitory if you want to use the script for something else in degrees or rads. There are 6400 mils to 360 degrees. 

Functionalities:
  1. Enter two map co-ordinates - returns a bearing between the two points
  2. Enter a co-ordinate, bearing and a distance - returns a co-ordinate of the line that would be drawn
  3. Enter a co-ordinate for the position of a Flank Firing Gun and the Position of Troops to get a safe axis. (This is for the construction of British Army LFTT ranges, more a confirmatory than anything)
